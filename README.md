# üöó Self-Driving-Car-CARLA-ROS2 üöÄ
A project to **develop a self-driving car** using the **CARLA simulator** and **ROS2 CARLA bridge**.

Here, we are aiming to build a software stack step by step to **drive a car in the CARLA simulator autonomously** with **ROS2 Humble**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Software Requirements
1.  **Ubuntu 22.04**
2.  **ROS2 Humble**
3.  **CARLA 0.9.15.0**
4.  **CARLA ROS2 HUMBLE bridge**
5.  **Python 3.10.12**

## ü§î What is a self-driving car?

A **self-driving car** is a vehicle equipped with **sensors, software, and control systems** that enable it to **navigate and drive itself without human input**.
It **perceives its environment** (roads, traffic, pedestrians, obstacles), **makes decisions**, and **controls motion** (steering, acceleration, braking) to **reach a destination safely and efficiently**.

Self-driving cars use technologies like:
1.  **Sensors:** cameras, lidar, radar, ultrasonic sensors.
2.  **Software:** perception algorithms, planning, control, and decision-making systems.
3.  **AI/ML:** for object detection, path planning, behavior prediction.
4.  **Connectivity:** GPS, HD maps, sometimes V2X (vehicle-to-everything) communication.


## üõ†Ô∏è What do we need to build a self-driving car?
1.  A vehicle
2.  Required sensors attached to the vehicle.
3.  A control system/master processing unit.
4.  Actuators to control the vehicle based on the control signals from the controller.
5.  A world to test the vehicle with different road conditions and scenarios.

As we know, creating a test vehicle with the above requirements is expensive, and testing the vehicle with different scenarios is not an easy job.
Instead, the **easy way is to use a simulator** where we can create a vehicle with complex sensors within a virtual world.

In this project, we are going to use the **CARLA SIMULATOR** ‚Äì a really heavy simulator (consider a performance laptop/workstation).
And we can **read the sensor data** from this vehicle with the **Python API/ROS bridge**.
Also, we can **control the vehicle** with the **API/ROS bridge**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisite
1.  A PC with **Ubuntu 22.04 OS** installed (with dedicated graphics).
2.  **ROS2 Humble** installed.

## üö¶ PHASE-1: A SIMPLE ROUTE FOLLOWING VEHICLE (WAYPOINT FOLLOWER)
1.  In this phase, the **basic objective of a self-driving car will be implemented**.
2.  The basic objective is to **drive a car from a starting point to a destination point**.
3.  Here, we are **not bothering about collisions, traffic rules, or complex maneuvers**.

### üïπÔ∏è Step-by-step operation to do it with CARLA, ROS2, CARLA ROS2 bridge
1.  Start **CARLA server** and source  CARLA ROS2 bridge. 
2.  **Spawn a vehicle**.
3.  Use a **route planner** to find the best route from the vehicle's location to the destination point.
4.  Use a **controller** to control the vehicle to follow the route.
5.  Use **Navigation HMI** to select the destination location on the map.




### 1. üåç Start **CARLA server** and source  CARLA ROS2 bridge. 
1.  **Run the CARLA server.**
    Open a new terminal (terminal 1) and run the following command to start the CARLA server:

    ```bash
    bash CARLA_PROJECT/CARLA_0.9.15/CarlaUE4.sh -prefernvidia
    ```

2.  **Source ROS2 HUMBLE.**
    Open a new terminal (terminal 2) and run the following command to source ROS2:

    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    ```

3.  **üîó Source the ROS2 CARLA Bridge.**
    In terminal 2, run the following command:

    ```bash
    source $HOME/CARLA_PROJECT/ros2_bridge_ws/ros-bridge/install/setup.bash
    export CARLA_ROOT=$HOME/CARLA_PROJECT/CARLA_0.9.15
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla
    ```

### 2. üöó Spawn a vehicle
1.  Use a **ROS2 package to spawn a vehicle**.
    In terminal 2, run the following command:

    ```bash
    ros2 launch carla_ros_bridge carla_ros_bridge_with_example_ego_vehicle.launch.py
    ```

### 3. üß≠ Use a route planner to find the best route from the vehicle's location to the destination point.
1.  For route planning, we will be using the **waypoint publisher**, which is part of the ROS2 package.
    To initiate the waypoint publisher, run the following command in a new terminal (terminal 3):

    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    source $HOME/CARLA_PROJECT/ros2_bridge_ws/ros-bridge/install/setup.bash
    export CARLA_ROOT=$HOME/CARLA_PROJECT/CARLA_0.9.15
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla
    ros2 launch carla_waypoint_publisher carla_waypoint_publisher.launch.py
    ```

### 4. ‚öôÔ∏è Use a controller to control the vehicle to follow the route.
1.  We will be using the **local planner package** in the CARLA ROS2 bridge for controlling the vehicle or to follow the published waypoints (route) in CARLA.
    To initiate the local planner, please run the following command from a new terminal (terminal 4) as follows:

    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    source $HOME/CARLA_PROJECT/ros2_bridge_ws/ros-bridge/install/setup.bash
    export CARLA_ROOT=$HOME/CARLA_PROJECT/CARLA_0.9.15
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla
    ros2 run carla_ad_agent local_planner
    ```


### 5. üéØ Use Navigation HMI to select the destination location on the map.
1.  **Source the navigation package.**
    Open a new terminal (terminal 5) and run the following command:

    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
    source $HOME/CARLA_PROJECT/ros2_bridge_ws/ros-bridge/install/setup.bash
    export CARLA_ROOT=$HOME/CARLA_PROJECT/CARLA_0.9.15
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla
    source  CARLA_PROJECT/carla_ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
    ```

2.  **Run the navigation node** with the following command:

    ```bash
    ros2 run navigation navigation_hmi
    ```

3.  **Launch RViz 2** in a new terminal (terminal 6):

    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash    
    rviz2
    ```

4.  Select the `carla_road_network` topic to **visualize the road network** in RViz 2.
5.  Select the `carla/markers` topic to **visualize the vehicle** in RViz 2.
6.  Select the `carla/waypoints` topic to **Visualize the published route** in Rviz 2.
7.  Now choose the **"Goal Pose" option** to select the destination point in the road network.
8.  Once you select the goal pose, you can **see the new route created by the waypoint publisher** on the map.
9.  And at this moment, the **vehicle will start driving towards this location**.
